The main goal of Rigby's NSERC Discovery grant, “Contemporary Software Peer Review:
Modern practices, fault prediction, and extraction of design decisions” is to
understand the software review practices in industrial firms as opposed to open
source projects he studied in my thesis (from this grant, I have published a
paper at the top tier conference “Foundations of Software Engineering”). 
%
In the proposed grant, I will be able to use my expertise and scripts to
extract Ericsson data. A possible synergy between the grants, would be to use
peer review data in models for test prioritization. 

The goal of Rigby's FRQNT grant is to translate code elements, classes and methods,
from English into French. This grant does not overlap with the proposed grant.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Ian's other research grant%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Shang is currently holding a NSERC Discovery grant, a startup grant from Concordia University and a Microsoft Azure Award. Here we explain the relationship of this proposal to the above three grants:

NSERC Discovery grant (Awarded): Shang received a NSERC Discovery grant ``Log Intelligence: Systematically Leveraging Logs Using Development Knowledge''. The goal of this grant is to systematically help developers make logging decisions and improve log analysis, using the rich historical knowledge from software development. The Discovery grant is targetting production logs instead of testing logs in this proposal. The success of project from Shang's NSERC Discovery grant may further improve the effectiveness of techniques in the proposed grant.

Startup Grant (Awarded): As a new faculty member at Concordia, Shang received a start-up grant of \$50,000 for three years (from August 2015 - April 2018). The start-up funds are being used to perform studies on the modeling the performance of large software systems, which is not related to this proposal. 

Microsoft Azure Award (Awarded): Shang received a Microsoft Azure Award (\$20,000) in May, 2016. The award provides infrastructure support for my research titled ``Evaluating the use of cloud environment for performance testing''. The proposed research aims to study the discrepancy between performance testing results in cloud and physical environment. The proposed research leverages Microsoft Azure cloud environment to conduct performance tests and identify the discrepancy and stability of performance testing results compared to physical environment. The Microsoft Azure Award is not relevant to the work described in this proposal.
