Ericsson Ottawa's in-kind contribution will be substantial. The main point of
contact will be Griffiths, who is the Section Manager for the Development
Environment in Ottawa. Engineers on Griffiths's team will have to introduce the
research team, especially the on-site masters student, to the test and
development processes. They will also help the masters student to extract
appropriate attributes and interpret them in context.  Rigby and Rahman will
visit Ericsson at least twice a month to meet with Griffiths's team and to help
the masters student with data mining and modeling. Further, McKenna, the lead
test Engineer, will help in evaluating the results and ensuring that they have
an impact on Ericsson's continuous integration environment. 

Over the six month period of the grant, we expect the teams to contribute 
an average of 12 hours per week. The on-site student will also be
provided with a workstation and access to test equiment. In total, the in-kind
contribution will be \$15,000.
