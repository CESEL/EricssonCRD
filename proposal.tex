\section{Research Milestones} 

This research proposal builds upon an NSERC Engage and an ongoing MITACs. For
each milestone, we describe the work that we have done over the last six months
and the direction we plan for this proposal. The proposal consists of \todo{X}
milestones. In Milestone 1, we will evaluate test effectiveness and build a
test prioritization model. In Milestone 2, we will use the test failure
distribution to find anomalies and differentiate between product and
environmental faults. In Milestone 3, we will improve fault localization by
mining test logs. In Milestone 4, we integrate our results and use them to
quantify the change risk associated with test failures and relate them to
customer found defects to identify which tests should be run for a change,
which tests should be run after a failure, and which tests should be written to
stop fault slipthrough to customers.  We integrate our work into a framework
that provides actionable, timely results to Ericsson developers, we call this
tool TestGuru.

\section*{Benefit to Canada}

In 2009, Ericsson acquired the majority of Nortel's North American wireless
access business, including its market share and became the world leader in this
market. This human expertise remains in Canada where Ericsson employs about
1000 R\&D staff in Ottawa. Our contribution will be to make these individuals
more productive by improving the efficiency of the test process. If this NSERC
Engage collaboration proves to be beneficial, we will extend the project
through MITACS. We hope that this contribution leads to a long term
relationship with Ericsson Ottawa where we can attack their practical problems
and abstract them to the general advancement of knowledge in software
engineering.
